# tab2opf
Remake of tab2opf dictionary builder for kindle

Script to convert tab delimited dictionary files into opf file to run
with kindlegen into a translation lookup dictionary for kindle.

Based on the generally available tab2opf.py by Klokan Petr PÅ™idal
(www.klokan.cz) from 2007

The script has been mostly rewritten and extended. The encoding
convolutions have been removed, and the code migrated to python3

The input form is:
Word(s) \\t Definition

By running tab2opf.py path/file.txt in the current directory file.opf
and file*.html are created which can then be converted with kindlegen
file.opf into file.mobi

--source and --target options define which language to which we are
translating.

tab2opf has a -m option to load a module to load getkey and getdef
functions and mapping dictionary from that namespace into the current
one; if it doesn't find such defined member(s), no error is produced.

getkey converts the term (the Word(s)) into a search key.  getdef
converts Definition in some arbitrary way.  mapping is a dictionary
mapping from char -> char to replace some set of characters in the
input with characters in the output.

Used and tested is the dictcc.py, which converts a dict.cc german ->
english dictionary (http://www.dict.cc/?s=about%3Awordlist&l=e). The
keys are the longest word in the Word(s) after removal of
prepositional phrases and some pronouns (in getkey). The definitions
remap the dict.cc pattern of "definition \\t part-of-speech" into
(part-of-speech) definiton.
